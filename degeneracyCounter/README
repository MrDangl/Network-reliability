Generates the number of networks given a certain link densitiy l/l_max. Will check against rotational symmetries (assumes a circular network) but not mirrored symmetries (yet).

Usage:
	degeneracyCounter <# nodes> [<# links>] [<prob. p of failure>] [<Q>]
		-number of links is optional, and if not defined or set to -1, D is calculated for all l's
		-probability p of failure is optional and defaults to 0.800000
		-number of iterations, Q, when estimating reliability, defaults to 100
