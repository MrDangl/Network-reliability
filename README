== Generate a Network ==
To generate a network, the python-script generateNetwork.py can be used:
	./generateNetwork.py <type> <cells wide> <rotations> <cells high>
	where 	<type> is one of {chain, ring, cylinder, toroid}
			<rotations> is only valid for the ring

== Reliability and Optimization ==
The Ant colony algorithm is implemented in the C-program main.cpp which calls 
other functions in graph.h. Compile with 
	make
	
To calculate the reliability with Monte carlo, run:
	./main -f <nwk-file>
	where <nwk-file> may have been generated from generateNetwork.py
	
Run ant colony on a network with:
	./main -f <nwk-file> -aco <max wanted links> <iterations> <ants>
